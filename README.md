# Diameter Of a Binary Tree

Java Implementation to find diameter (maximum number of nodes at a given level) of a binary tree using BFS.

Time Complexity: O(N)

Since, we have to visit every node atleast once.

Space Complexity: O(N)

For storing nodes in the queue. Though we won't be storing all the nodes at once, the space complexity would actually less than N throughout the traversal.
